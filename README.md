Authentication vs. Authorization: What's the difference?

Authentication and authorization are two fundamental concepts in security that are often confused with each other. In simple terms:

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system. It answers the question: "Who are you?"
Authorization is the process of determining what actions a user, device, or system can perform. It answers the question: "What can you do?"
Think of it like a nightclub:

Authentication is like checking your ID at the door. The bouncer verifies your identity to ensure you're who you claim to be.
Authorization is like checking your VIP pass. Once you're inside, the bouncer checks your pass to determine what areas of the club you can access.
Is the "Delete User" Functionality a Good Idea?

Now, let's evaluate the "Delete User" functionality in the context of authentication and authorization. Requiring authentication before deleting a user is a good idea because it ensures that only authorized users can perform this action. However, it's not enough.

In a real-world scenario, you would want to implement additional authorization checks to ensure that only users with the necessary permissions can delete other users. For example, you might want to restrict this action to administrators or moderators.

Without proper authorization, the "Delete User" functionality can be abused by malicious users, leading to security vulnerabilities and data breaches.

Conclusion

In conclusion, while authentication is an essential step in securing the "Delete User" functionality, it's not enough on its own. Authorization plays a critical role in determining what actions a user can perform, and it's essential to implement additional checks to ensure that only authorized users can delete other users.
